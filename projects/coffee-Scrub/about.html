        <h4>WHAT IS A COFFEE SCRUB?</h4>
        <img src="./body-scrub.jpg" width=200px height=200px>
        <p>A coffee scrub is basically what you think it is: a face or body scrub formulated with coffee. To get more specific, coffee scrubs are a type of mechanical exfoliation—that means they physically remove dead skin cells from your skin’s surface through the act of sloughing your skin. With a coffee scrub, finely-ground coffee particles are used to do the exfoliating.</p> 
        <h4>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF A COFFEE SCRUB?</h4>
        <p> As with all scrubs, a coffee scrub can help exfoliate the surface of your skin, lifting away dull, dead skin cell buildup and leaving you with a complexion that looks more radiant. And, just as drinking coffee can help make you feel more energized, when used in skin care products, coffee can help energize the look of your skin. (That’s why it makes sense that you tend to see eye creams formulated with caffeine, as your under-eye area can be a dead giveaway that you’re sorely lacking energy.)</p><br>
        <p>You may have heard of using coffee scrubs for cellulite, and that’s because research has found that products containing caffeine may dehydrate cells, which can make cellulite less obvious—though not get rid of it—per the American Academy of Dermatology. While it may not make your dimpled skin disappear, you can try using a coffee body scrub for cellulite.</p>
